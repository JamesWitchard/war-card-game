# War: The Card Game
Two players draw five cards. They then conduct a skirmish where each round they choose a card to play. Both cards are 
"discarded," so the player with an Ace of Hearts can't just sweep the entire deck. When a player wins best out of three, 
they "capture" their opponent's entire hand, sending the cards to the bottom of their own deck. The loser player draws 
another five cards and the game continues until the war is won and no player has any cards left.

## The Idea
This started off as a project I was following an online tutorial for, but I wanted to try and remake it with React. The 
original version of the tutorial [which can be found here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxRwIZWjLtE). Just had one 
card rounds, and I came up with the idea of having it be based on drawn hands to try and make it my own. Plus this will
help build skills for later down the line when I try to recreate a family favorite card game.

### Originality?
Honestly I have no idea if this version of the game already exists. I just thought of ways to make the game a little 
more advanced so I'm actually doing something myself and not just following tutorials. I also like the idea of there 
being a form of strategy involved, instead of it just being a pure lucky draw. Do you risk your more powerful units 
first? Or keep them for a later sweep.

## The Future
Initially the project will be made to play against an AI (which at the moment will just play the highest card in their 
hand with little to no strategy), but I also want to look into making it multiplayer, again to help build skills working 
with online functionality to interact with other players. Maybe some form of chat functionality as well.
